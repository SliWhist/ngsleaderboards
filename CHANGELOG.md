1.1:

Added Ordinal Tower rankings.
As of release, there aren't any runs logged. This will likely change when sega runs the cancelled arks record.

Added custom trophy icons for Rankings 1 - 3. Just a small bit of visual flair!

Added support for setting a runner's name to one of three options based on runner preference: Player Name, (Primary) Character Name, and In-Video Name.
    - As a result of this feature, you can now highlight names for their in-video name, assuming they don't have it set as their default.

Added runner information! You can now click on some names for more information about a runner!
    - This only has a lot of info if a runner asks for it to be added right now!
    - Features: Short Bio, Player Name & Main Character Name, Links to Youtube/Twitch/Twitter/Discord, Country Flag, Main Ship, and Main Server!

Added (Optional!) country flags! These are primarily unused right now, with most every run being set to Japan or Global, as opposed to a proper country per runner.
Psst! If you submit a run and include a country, I'll give you a flag if you want it!

Added (Optional!) ship indicators! Much like country flags, these are mostly unused. They'll come in Global ship 1-4 flavor and Japan Ship 1-??? flavor.

Added additional mobile support. (Made some things scrollable and/or smaller on mobile.) It's still far from perfect.

1.0b:

Fixed Duos (and higher) merging every party into one row.
Enabled HTML on bootstrap tooltips for notes.

1.0a:

Added more credits to the site.
Changed note color from red to yellow.
Links now open in a new tab.
