1.1:

Added Ordinal Tower rankings.
As of release, there aren't any runs logged. This will likely change when sega runs the cancelled arks record.

Added custom trophy icons for Rankings 1 - 3. Just a small bit of visual flair!

Added (Optional!) country flags! These are primarily unused right now, with most every run being set to Japan or Global, as opposed to a proper country per runner.
Psst! If you submit a run and include a country, I'll give you a flag if you want it!

Added (Optional!) ship indicators! Much like country flags, these are mostly unused. They'll come in Global ship 1-4 flavor and Japan Ship 1-??? flavor.
